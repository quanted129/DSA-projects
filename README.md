# Data Structures and Algorithms Projects

This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms projects implemented mostly in C++ as part of university coursework.

## Course information

The DSA BSU course covers fundamental computer science concepts of code efficiency and time/memory optimization involving various algorithm techniques and data structures. The projects in this repository provide solutions to general course problems, as well as individual tasks.

*Note: code may sometimes be in a non-optimal configuration for readability to meet certain automatic testing requirements!*

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: C++
- **Standard**: C++23
- **Development environment**: JetBrains CLion 2025.2.3

## Compilation Instructions

### Basic Compilation

- Make sure your GCC/G++ compiler is added to PATH!
- Clone the repository, navigate to desired project path
- Click "Open in Terminal" *(if unavailable change working directory using cd)*

```
g++ main.cpp -o program
./program
```

*Note: some projects require input files! Ensure the required input files (e.g., input.txt or in.txt) are present in the same directory before running the program.*
